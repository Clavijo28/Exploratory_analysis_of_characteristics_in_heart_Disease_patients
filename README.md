INTRODUCTION

The following statistical study is focused on performing an exploratory data analysis that allows 
a good selection of characteristics to be exercised for a preventive model of heart diseases. 
Many of the characteristics found in a group of data may not have sufficient relevance for a 
prediction model, in this case we have 14 variables, both qualitative and quantitative, where 
their attributes may have a number of significant data or not with respect to the variable. 
response. Many of the studies include histograms for the extraction of basic measures of 
central tendency, with this it will be enough to exercise a grouping of attributes (removing 
others) which will be evaluated through a correlation study to extract the best characteristics 
of the predictive model.
It should also be noted that this type of exploratory analysis is essential for managing attributes 
in the prediction of other types of diseases: the current pandemic, for example, has left certain 
values of uncertainty in terms of infections, since the behaviour of people can reach be erratic 
That is why it is necessary to undertake a good selection of characteristics to choose the best 
possible model and reduce said ranges of uncertainty. Below is the exploratory data analysis 
and the selection of variables and attributes with respect to some scientific papers 
investigated.
